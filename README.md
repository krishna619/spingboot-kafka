## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Kafka (running locally or accessible via network)
- Maven (for building the project)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Spring Boot Kafka example, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/krishna619/spingboot-kafka.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd spingboot-kafka
   ```

3. Configure Kafka connection properties:

   Open the `application.properties` file and update the Kafka broker URL, topic name, and other relevant properties according to your Kafka setup.

4. Build the application:

   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The Spring Boot Kafka application should now be up and running.

## Usage

Once the application is running, it provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /messages`: Send a message to the Kafka topic specified in the configuration.
- `GET /messages`: Retrieve the messages consumed from the Kafka topic.

You can use tools like cURL or Postman to interact with the API endpoints.
